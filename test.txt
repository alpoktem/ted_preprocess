_ i _ think _ i _ was _ supposed _ to _ talk _ about _ my _ new _ book , which _ is _ called _ blink , and _ it's _ about _ snap _ judgments _ and _ first _ impressions . and _ it _ comes _ out _ in _ january , and _ i _ hope _ you _ all _ buy _ it _ in _ triplicate . but _ i _ was _ thinking _ about _ this , and _ i _ realized _ that _ although _ my _ new _ book _ makes _ me _ happy , and _ i _ think _ would _ make _ my _ mother _ happy , it's _ not _ really _ about _ happiness . so _ i _ decided _ instead , i _ would _ talk _ about _ someone _ who _ i _ think _ has _ done _ as _ much _ to _ make _ americans _ happy _ as _ perhaps _ anyone _ over _ the _ last _ twenty _ years , a _ man _ who _ is _ a _ great _ personal _ hero _ of _ mine . someone _ by _ the _ name _ of _ howard _ moskowitz , who _ is _ most _ famous _ for _ reinventing _ spaghetti _ sauce . howard's _ about _ this _ high , and _ he's _ round , and _ he's _ in _ his _ sixties , and _ he _ has _ big _ huge _ glasses _ and _ thinning _ gray _ hair , and _ he _ has _ a _ kind _ of _ wonderful _ exuberance _ and _ vitality , and _ he _ has _ a _ parrot , and _ he _ loves _ the _ opera , and _ he's _ a _ great _ aficionado _ of _ medieval _ history . and _ by _ profession , he's _ a _ psychophysicist . now , i _ should _ tell _ you _ that _ i _ have _ no _ idea _ what _ psychophysics _ is , although _ at _ some _ point _ in _ my _ life , i _ dated _ a _ girl _ for _ two _ years _ who _ was _ getting _ her _ doctorate _ in _ psychophysics . which _ should _ tell _ you _ something _ about _ that _ relationship . as _ far _ as _ i _ know , psychophysics _ is _ about _ measuring _ things . and _ howard _ is _ very _ interested _ in _ measuring _ things . and _ he _ graduated _ with _ his _ doctorate _ from _ harvard , and _ he _ set _ up _ a _ little _ consulting _ shop _ in _ white _ plains , new _ york . and _ one _ of _ his _ first _ clients _ was _ pepsi . this _ is _ many _ years _ ago , back _ in _ the _ early _ seventies . and _ pepsi _ came _ to _ howard _ and _ they _ said , you _ know , there's _ this _ new _ thing _ called _ aspartame , and _ we _ would _ like _ to _ make _ diet _ pepsi . we'd _ like _ you _ to _ figure _ out _ how _ much _ aspartame _ we _ should _ put _ in _ each _ can _ of _ diet _ pepsi _ in _ order _ to _ have _ the _ perfect _ drink . now _ that _ sounds _ like _ an _ incredibly _ straightforward _ question _ to _ answer , and _ that's _ what _ howard _ thought . because _ pepsi _ told _ him , we're _ working _ with _ a _ band _ between _ eight _ and _ twelve _ percent . anything _ below _ eight _ percent _ sweetness _ is _ not _ sweet _ enough . anything _ above _ twelve _ percent _ sweetness _ is _ too _ sweet . we _ want _ to _ know . what's _ the _ sweet _ spot _ between _ eight _ and _ twelve ? now , if _ i _ gave _ you _ this _ problem _ to _ do , you _ would _ all _ say , it's _ very _ simple . what _ we _ do _ is _ you _ make _ up _ a _ big _ experimental _ batch _ of _ pepsi , at _ every _ degree _ of _ sweetness _ eight _ percent , eight _ point _ one , eight _ point _ two , eight _ point _ three , all _ the _ way _ up _ to _ twelve _ and _ we _ try _ this _ out _ with _ thousands _ of _ people , and _ we _ plot _ the _ results _ on _ a _ curve , and _ we _ take _ the _ most _ popular _ concentration , right ? really _ simple . howard _ does _ the _ experiment , and _ he _ gets _ the _ data _ back , and _ he _ plots _ it _ on _ a _ curve , and _ all _ of _ a _ sudden _ he _ realizes _ it's _ not _ a _ nice _ bell _ curve . in _ fact , the _ data _ doesn't _ make _ any _ sense . it's _ a _ mess . it's _ all _ over _ the _ place . now , most _ people _ in _ that _ business , in _ the _ world _ of _ testing _ food _ and _ such , are _ not _ dismayed _ when _ the _ data _ comes _ back _ a _ mess . they _ think , well , you _ know , figuring _ out _ what _ people _ think _ about _ cola's _ not _ that _ easy . you _ know , maybe _ we _ made _ an _ error _ somewhere _ along _ the _ way . you _ know , let's _ just _ make _ an _ educated _ guess , and _ they _ simply _ point _ and _ they _ go _ for _ ten _ percent , right _ in _ the _ middle . howard _ is _ not _ so _ easily _ placated . howard _ is _ a _ man _ of _ a _ certain _ degree _ of _ intellectual _ standards . and _ this _ was _ not _ good _ enough _ for _ him , and _ this _ question _ bedeviled _ him _ for _ years . and _ he _ would _ think _ it _ through _ and _ say , what _ was _ wrong ? why _ could _ we _ not _ make _ sense _ of _ this _ experiment _ with _ diet _ pepsi ? and _ one _ day , he _ was _ sitting _ in _ a _ diner _ in _ white _ plains , about _ to _ go _ trying _ to _ dream _ up _ some _ work _ for _ nescaf . and _ suddenly , like _ a _ bolt _ of _ lightning , the _ answer _ came _ to _ him . and _ that _ is , that _ when _ they _ analyzed _ the _ diet _ pepsi _ data , they _ were _ asking _ the _ wrong _ question . they _ were _ looking _ for _ the _ perfect _ pepsi , and _ they _ should _ have _ been _ looking _ for _ the _ perfect _ pepsis . trust _ me . this _ was _ an _ enormous _ revelation . this _ was _ one _ of _ the _ most _ brilliant _ breakthroughs _ in _ all _ of _ food _ science . howard _ immediately _ went _ on _ the _ road , and _ he _ would _ go _ to _ conferences _ around _ the _ country , and _ he _ would _ stand _ up _ and _ say , you _ had _ been _ looking _ for _ the _ perfect _ pepsi . you're _ wrong . you _ should _ be _ looking _ for _ the _ perfect _ pepsis . and _ people _ would _ look _ at _ him _ blankly _ and _ say , what _ are _ you _ talking _ about ? craziness . and _ they _ would _ say , move . next . tried _ to _ get _ business , nobody _ would _ hire _ him _ he _ was _ obsessed , though , and _ he _ talked _ about _ it _ and _ talked _ about _ it . howard _ loves _ the _ yiddish _ expression _ to _ a _ worm _ in _ horseradish , the _ world _ is _ horseradish . this _ was _ his _ horseradish . he _ was _ obsessed _ with _ it . and _ finally , he _ had _ a _ breakthrough . vlasic _ pickles _ came _ to _ him , and _ they _ said , doctor _ moskowitz , we _ want _ to _ make _ the _ perfect _ pickle . and _ he _ said , there _ is _ no _ perfect _ pickle . there _ are _ only _ perfect _ pickles . and _ he _ came _ back _ to _ them _ and _ he _ said , you _ don't _ just _ need _ to _ improve _ your _ regular . you _ need _ to _ create _ zesty . and _ that's _ where _ we _ got _ zesty _ pickles . then _ the _ next _ person _ came _ to _ him . campbell's _ soup . and _ this _ was _ even _ more _ important . in _ fact , campbell's _ soup _ is _ where _ howard _ made _ his _ reputation . campbell's _ made _ prego , and _ prego , in _ the _ early _ eighties , was _ struggling _ next _ to _ rag , which _ was _ the _ dominant _ spaghetti _ sauce _ of _ the _ seventies _ and _ eighties . in _ the _ industry _ i _ don't _ know _ whether _ you _ care _ about _ this , or _ how _ much _ time _ i _ have _ to _ go _ into _ this . but _ it _ was , technically _ speaking _ this _ is _ an _ aside _ prego _ is _ a _ better _ tomato _ sauce _ than _ rag . the _ quality _ of _ the _ tomato _ paste _ is _ much _ better . the _ spice _ mix _ is _ far _ superior . it _ adheres _ to _ the _ pasta _ in _ a _ much _ more _ pleasing _ way . in _ fact , they _ would _ do _ the _ famous _ bowl _ test _ back _ in _ the _ seventies _ with _ rag _ and _ prego . you'd _ have _ a _ plate _ of _ spaghetti , and _ you _ would _ pour _ it _ on , right ? and _ the _ rag _ would _ all _ go _ to _ the _ bottom , and _ the _ prego _ would _ sit _ on _ top . that's _ called _ adherence . and , anyway , despite _ the _ fact _ that _ they _ were _ far _ superior _ in _ adherence , and _ the _ quality _ of _ their _ tomato _ paste , prego _ was _ struggling . so _ they _ came _ to _ howard , and _ they _ said , fix _ us . and _ howard _ looked _ at _ their _ product _ line , and _ he _ said , what _ you _ have _ is _ a _ dead _ tomato _ society . so _ he _ said , this _ is _ what _ i _ want _ to _ do . and _ he _ got _ together _ with _ the _ campbell's _ soup _ kitchen , and _ he _ made _ forty _ five _ varieties _ of _ spaghetti _ sauce . and _ he _ varied _ them _ according _ to _ every _ conceivable _ way _ that _ you _ can _ vary _ tomato _ sauce . by _ sweetness , by _ level _ of _ garlic , by _ tomatoey _ ness , by _ tartness , by _ sourness , by _ visible _ solids _ my _ favorite _ term _ in _ the _ spaghetti _ sauce _ business . every _ conceivable _ way _ you _ can _ vary _ spaghetti _ sauce , he _ varied _ spaghetti _ sauce . and _ then _ he _ took _ this _ whole _ raft _ of _ forty _ five _ spaghetti _ sauces , and _ he _ went _ on _ the _ road . he _ went _ to _ new _ york , to _ chicago , he _ went _ to _ jacksonville , to _ los _ angeles . and _ he _ brought _ in _ people _ by _ the _ truckload _ into _ big _ halls . and _ he _ sat _ them _ down _ for _ two _ hours , and _ over _ the _ course _ of _ that _ two _ hours , he _ gave _ them _ ten _ bowls . ten _ small _ bowls _ of _ pasta , with _ a _ different _ spaghetti _ sauce _ on _ each _ one . and _ after _ they _ ate _ each _ bowl , they _ had _ to _ rate , from _ zero _ to _ one _ hundred , how _ good _ they _ thought _ the _ spaghetti _ sauce _ was . at _ the _ end _ of _ that _ process , after _ doing _ it _ for _ months _ and _ months , he _ had _ a _ mountain _ of _ data _ about _ how _ the _ american _ people _ feel _ about _ spaghetti _ sauce . and _ then _ he _ analyzed _ the _ data . did _ he _ look _ for _ the _ most _ popular _ variety _ of _ spaghetti _ sauce ? no . howard _ doesn't _ believe _ that _ there _ is _ such _ a _ thing . instead , he _ looked _ at _ the _ data , and _ he _ said , let's _ see _ if _ we _ can _ group _ all _ these _ different _ data _ points _ into _ clusters . let's _ see _ if _ they _ congregate _ around _ certain _ ideas . and _ sure _ enough , if _ you _ sit _ down , and _ you _ analyze _ all _ this _ data _ on _ spaghetti _ sauce , you _ realize _ that _ all _ americans _ fall _ into _ one _ of _ three _ groups . there _ are _ people _ who _ like _ their _ spaghetti _ sauce _ plain . there _ are _ people _ who _ like _ their _ spaghetti _ sauce _ spicy . and _ there _ are _ people _ who _ like _ it _ extra _ chunky . and _ of _ those _ three _ facts , the _ third _ one _ was _ the _ most _ significant , because _ at _ the _ time , in _ the _ early _ nineteen _ eighties , if _ you _ went _ to _ a _ supermarket , you _ would _ not _ find _ extra _ chunky _ spaghetti _ sauce . and _ prego _ turned _ to _ howard , and _ they _ said , you're _ telling _ me _ that _ one _ third _ of _ americans _ crave _ extra _ chunky _ spaghetti _ sauce _ and _ yet _ no _ one _ is _ servicing _ their _ needs ? and _ he _ said _ yes . and _ prego _ then _ went _ back , and _ completely _ reformulated _ their _ spaghetti _ sauce , and _ came _ out _ with _ a _ line _ of _ extra _ chunky _ that _ immediately _ and _ completely _ took _ over _ the _ spaghetti _ sauce _ business _ in _ this _ country . and _ over _ the _ next _ ten _ years , they _ made _ six _ hundred _ million _ dollars _ off _ their _ line _ of _ extra _ chunky _ sauces . everyone _ else _ in _ the _ industry _ looked _ at _ howard _ had _ done , and _ they _ said , oh _ my _ god . we've _ been _ thinking _ all _ wrong . and _ that's _ when _ you _ started _ to _ get _ seven _ different _ kinds _ of _ vinegar , and _ fourteen _ different _ kinds _ of _ mustard , and _ seventy _ one _ different _ kinds _ of _ olive _ oil . and _ then _ eventually _ even _ rag _ hired _ howard , and _ howard _ did _ the _ exact _ same _ thing _ for _ rag _ that _ he _ did _ for _ prego . and _ today , if _ you _ go _ to _ a _ really _ good _ supermarket , do _ you _ know _ how _ many _ ragùs _ there _ are ? thirty _ six . in _ six _ varieties . cheese , light , robusto , rich _ and _ hearty , old _ world _ traditional _ extra _ chunky _ garden . that's _ howard's _ doing . that _ is _ howard's _ gift _ to _ the _ american _ people . now _ why _ is _ that _ important ? it _ is , in _ fact , enormously _ important . i'll _ explain _ to _ you _ why . what _ howard _ did _ is _ he _ fundamentally _ changed _ the _ way _ the _ food _ industry _ thinks _ about _ making _ you _ happy . assumption _ number _ one _ in _ the _ food _ industry _ used _ to _ be _ that _ the _ way _ to _ find _ out _ what _ people _ want _ to _ eat , what _ will _ make _ people _ happy , is _ to _ ask _ them . and _ for _ years _ and _ years _ and _ years , rag _ and _ prego _ would _ have _ focus _ groups , and _ they _ would _ sit _ you _ down , and _ they _ would _ say , what _ do _ you _ want _ in _ a _ spaghetti _ sauce ? tell _ us _ what _ you _ want _ in _ a _ spaghetti _ sauce . and _ for _ all _ those _ years _ twenty , thirty _ years _ through _ all _ those _ focus _ group _ sessions , no _ one _ ever _ said _ they _ wanted _ extra _ chunky . even _ though _ at _ least _ a _ third _ of _ them , deep _ in _ their _ hearts , actually _ did . people _ don't _ know _ what _ they _ want . as _ howard _ loves _ to _ say , the _ mind _ knows _ not _ what _ the _ tongue _ wants . it's _ a _ mystery . and _ a _ critically _ important _ step _ in _ understanding _ our _ own _ desires _ and _ tastes _ is _ to _ realize _ that _ we _ cannot _ always _ explain _ what _ we _ want , deep _ down . if _ i _ asked _ all _ of _ you , for _ example , in _ this _ room , what _ you _ want _ in _ a _ coffee , you _ know _ what _ you'd _ say ? every _ one _ of _ you _ would _ say , i _ want _ a _ dark , rich , hearty _ roast . it's _ what _ people _ always _ say _ when _ you _ ask _ them . what _ do _ you _ like ? dark , rich , hearty _ roast . what _ percentage _ of _ you _ actually _ like _ a _ dark , rich , hearty _ roast ? according _ to _ howard , somewhere _ between _ twenty _ five _ and _ twenty _ seven _ percent _ of _ you . most _ of _ you _ like _ milky , weak _ coffee . but _ you _ will _ never , ever _ say _ to _ someone _ who _ asks _ you _ what _ you _ want _ that _ i _ want _ a _ milky , weak _ coffee . so _ that's _ number _ one _ thing _ that _ howard _ did . number _ two _ thing _ that _ howard _ did _ is _ he _ made _ us _ realize _ it's _ another _ very _ critical _ point _ he _ made _ us _ realize _ the _ importance _ of _ what _ he _ likes _ to _ call _ horizontal _ segmentation . why _ is _ this _ critical ? because _ this _ is _ the _ way _ the _ food _ industry _ thought _ before _ howard . what _ were _ they _ obsessed _ with _ in _ the _ early _ eighties ? they _ were _ obsessed _ with _ mustard . in _ particular , they _ were _ obsessed _ with _ the _ story _ of _ grey _ poupon . used _ to _ be , there _ were _ two _ mustards . french's _ and _ gulden's . what _ were _ they ? yellow _ mustard . what's _ in _ it ? yellow _ mustard _ seeds , turmeric , and _ paprika . that _ was _ mustard . grey _ poupon _ came _ along , with _ a _ dijon . right ? much _ more _ volatile _ brown _ mustard _ seed , some _ white _ wine , a _ nose _ hit , much _ more _ delicate _ aromatics . and _ what _ do _ they _ do ? they _ put _ it _ in _ a _ little _ tiny _ glass _ jar , with _ a _ wonderful _ enameled _ label _ on _ it , made _ it _ look _ french , even _ though _ it's _ made _ in _ oxnard , california . and _ instead _ of _ charging _ a _ dollar _ fifty _ for _ the _ eight _ ounce _ bottle , the _ way _ that _ french's _ and _ gulden's _ did , they _ decided _ to _ charge _ four _ dollars . and _ they _ had _ those _ ads . with _ the _ guy _ in _ the _ rolls _ royce , eating _ the _ grey _ poupon . another _ pulls _ up , and _ says , do _ you _ have _ any _ grey _ poupon ? and _ the _ whole _ thing , after _ they _ did _ that , grey _ poupon _ takes _ off . takes _ over _ the _ mustard _ business . and _ everyone's _ take _ home _ lesson _ from _ that _ was _ that _ the _ way _ to _ make _ people _ happy _ is _ to _ give _ them _ something _ that _ is _ more _ expensive , something _ to _ aspire _ to . it's _ to _ make _ them _ turn _ their _ back _ on _ what _ they _ think _ they _ like _ now , and _ reach _ out _ for _ something _ higher _ up _ the _ mustard _ hierarchy . a _ better _ mustard . a _ more _ expensive _ mustard . a _ mustard _ of _ more _ sophistication _ and _ culture _ and _ meaning . and _ howard _ looked _ to _ that _ and _ said , that's _ wrong . mustard _ does _ not _ exist _ on _ a _ hierarchy . mustard _ exists , just _ like _ tomato _ sauce , on _ a _ horizontal _ plane . there _ is _ no _ good _ mustard _ or _ bad _ mustard . there _ is _ no _ perfect _ mustard _ or _ imperfect _ mustard . there _ are _ only _ different _ kinds _ of _ mustards _ that _ suit _ different _ kinds _ of _ people . he _ fundamentally _ democratized _ the _ way _ we _ think _ about _ taste . and _ for _ that , as _ well , we _ owe _ howard _ moskowitz _ a _ huge _ vote _ of _ thanks . third _ thing _ that _ howard _ did , and _ perhaps _ the _ most _ important , is _ howard _ confronted _ the _ notion _ of _ the _ platonic _ dish . what _ do _ i _ mean _ by _ that ? for _ the _ longest _ time _ in _ the _ food _ industry , there _ was _ a _ sense _ that _ there _ was _ one _ way , a _ perfect _ way , to _ make _ a _ dish . you _ go _ to _ chez _ panisse , they _ give _ you _ the _ red _ tail _ sashimi _ with _ roasted _ pumpkin _ seeds _ in _ a _ something _ something _ reduction . they _ don't _ give _ you _ five _ options _ on _ the _ reduction . they _ don't _ say , do _ you _ want _ the _ extra _ chunky _ reduction , or _ no . you _ just _ get _ the _ reduction . why ? because _ the _ chef _ at _ chez _ panisse _ has _ a _ platonic _ notion _ about _ red _ tail _ sashimi . this _ is _ the _ way _ it _ ought _ to _ be . and _ she _ serves _ it _ that _ way _ time _ and _ time _ again , and _ if _ you _ quarrel _ with _ her , she _ will _ say , you _ know _ what ? you're _ wrong . this _ is _ the _ best _ way _ it _ ought _ to _ be _ in _ this _ restaurant . now _ that _ same _ idea _ fueled _ the _ commercial _ food _ industry _ as _ well . they _ had _ a _ platonic _ notion _ of _ what _ tomato _ sauce _ was . and _ where _ did _ that _ come _ from ? it _ came _ from _ italy . italian _ tomato _ sauce _ is _ what ? it's _ blended . it's _ thin . the _ culture _ of _ tomato _ sauce _ was _ thin . when _ we _ talked _ about _ authentic _ tomato _ sauce _ in _ the _ nineteen _ seventies , we _ talked _ about _ italian _ tomato _ sauce , we _ talked _ about _ the _ earliest _ ragùs , which _ had _ no _ visible _ solids , right ? which _ were _ thin , you _ just _ put _ a _ little _ bit _ and _ it _ sunk _ down _ to _ the _ bottom _ of _ the _ pasta . that's _ what _ it _ was . and _ why _ were _ we _ attached _ to _ that ? because _ we _ thought _ that _ what _ it _ took _ to _ make _ people _ happy _ was _ to _ provide _ them _ with _ the _ most _ culturally _ authentic _ tomato _ sauce , a . and _ b , we _ thought _ that _ if _ we _ gave _ them _ the _ culturally _ authentic _ tomato _ sauce , then _ they _ would _ embrace _ it . and _ that's _ what _ would _ please _ the _ maximum _ number _ of _ people . in _ other _ words , people _ in _ the _ cooking _ world _ were _ looking _ for _ cooking _ universals . they _ were _ looking _ for _ one _ way _ to _ treat _ all _ of _ us . and _ it's _ good _ reason _ for _ them _ to _ be _ obsessed _ with _ the _ idea _ of _ universals , because _ all _ of _ science , through _ the _ nineteenth _ century _ and _ much _ of _ the _ twentieth , was _ obsessed _ with _ universals . psychologists , medical _ scientists , economists _ were _ all _ interested _ in _ finding _ out _ the _ rules _ that _ govern _ the _ way _ all _ of _ us _ behave . but _ that _ changed , right ? what _ is _ the _ great _ revolution _ in _ science _ of _ the _ last _ ten , fifteen _ years ? it _ is _ the _ movement _ from _ the _ search _ for _ universals _ to _ the _ understanding _ of _ variability . now _ in _ medical _ science , we _ don't _ want _ to _ know , necessarily , just _ how _ cancer _ works , we _ want _ to _ know _ how _ your _ cancer _ is _ different _ from _ my _ cancer . i _ guess _ my _ cancer _ different _ from _ your _ cancer . genetics _ has _ opened _ the _ door _ to _ the _ study _ of _ human _ variability . what _ howard _ moskowitz _ was _ doing _ was _ saying , this _ same _ revolution _ needs _ to _ happen _ in _ the _ world _ of _ tomato _ sauce . and _ for _ that , we _ owe _ him _ a _ great _ vote _ of _ thanks . i'll _ give _ you _ one _ last _ illustration _ of _ variability , and _ that _ is _ oh , i'm _ sorry . howard _ not _ only _ believed _ that , but _ he _ took _ it _ a _ second _ step , which _ was _ to _ say _ that _ when _ we _ pursue _ universal _ principles _ in _ food , we _ aren't _ just _ making _ an _ error . we _ are _ actually _ doing _ ourselves _ a _ massive _ disservice . and _ the _ example _ he _ used _ was _ coffee . and _ coffee _ is _ something _ he _ did _ a _ lot _ of _ work _ with , with _ nescaf . if _ i _ were _ to _ ask _ all _ of _ you _ to _ try _ and _ come _ up _ with _ a _ brand _ of _ coffee _ a _ type _ of _ coffee , a _ brew _ that _ made _ all _ of _ you _ happy , and _ then _ i _ asked _ you _ to _ rate _ that _ coffee , the _ average _ score _ in _ this _ room _ for _ coffee _ would _ be _ about _ sixty _ on _ a _ scale _ of _ zero _ to _ one _ hundred . if , however , you _ allowed _ me _ to _ break _ you _ into _ coffee _ clusters , maybe _ three _ or _ four _ coffee _ clusters , and _ i _ could _ make _ coffee _ just _ for _ each _ of _ those _ individual _ clusters , your _ scores _ would _ go _ from _ sixty _ to _ seventy _ five _ or _ seventy _ eight . the _ difference _ between _ coffee _ at _ sixty _ and _ coffee _ at _ seventy _ eight _ is _ a _ difference _ between _ coffee _ that _ makes _ you _ wince , and _ coffee _ that _ makes _ you _ deliriously _ happy . that _ is _ the _ final , and _ i _ think _ most _ beautiful _ lesson , of _ that _ in _ embracing _ the _ diversity _ of _ human _ beings , we _ will _ find _ a _ surer _ way _ to _ true _ happiness . thank _ you _ over _ the _ past _ couple _ of _ days _ as _ i've _ been _ preparing _ for _ my _ speech , i've _ become _ more _ and _ more _ nervous _ about _ what _ i'm _ going _ to _ say _ and _ about _ being _ on _ the _ same _ stage _ as _ all _ these _ fascinating _ people . being _ on _ the _ same _ stage _ as _ al _ gore , who _ was _ the _ first _ person _ i _ ever _ voted _ for . and _ so _ i _ was _ getting _ pretty _ nervous _ and , you _ know , i _ didn't _ know _ that _ chris _ sits _ on _ the _ stage , and _ that's _ more _ nerve _ wracking . but _ then _ i _ started _ thinking _ about _ my _ family . i _ started _ thinking _ about _ my _ father _ and _ my _ grandfather _ and _ my _ great _ grandfather , and _ i _ realized _ that _ i _ had _ all _ of _ these _ teds _ going _ through _ my _ blood _ stream _ that _ i _ had _ to _ consider _ this _ my _ element . so , who _ am _ i ? chris _ kind _ of _ mentioned _ i _ started _ a _ company _ with _ my _ husband . we _ have _ about _ one _ hundred _ and _ twenty _ five _ people _ internationally . if _ you _ looked _ in _ the _ book , you _ saw _ this , which _ i _ really _ was _ appalled _ by . and _ because _ i _ wanted _ to _ impress _ you _ all _ with _ slides , since _ i _ saw _ the _ great _ presentations _ yesterday _ with _ graphs , i _ made _ a _ graph _ that _ moves , and _ i _ talk _ about _ the _ makeup _ of _ me . so , besides _ this _ freakish _ thing , this _ is _ my _ science _ slide . this _ is _ math , and _ this _ is _ science . this _ is _ genetics . this _ is _ my _ grandmother , and _ this _ is _ where _ i _ get _ this _ mouth . i'm _ a _ blogger , which , probably _ to _ a _ lot _ of _ you , means _ different _ things . you _ may _ have _ heard _ about _ the _ kryptonite _ lock _ brouhaha , where _ a _ blogger _ talked _ about _ how _ you _ hack , or _ break _ into , a _ kryptonite _ lock _ using _ a _ ballpoint _ pen , and _ it _ spread _ all _ over . kryptonite _ had _ to _ adjust _ the _ lock , and _ they _ had _ to _ address _ it _ to _ avoid _ too _ many _ customer _ concerns . you _ may _ have _ heard _ about _ rathergate , which _ was _ basically _ the _ result _ of _ bloggers _ realizing _ that _ the _ th _ in _ one _ hundred _ and _ eleven _ is _ not _ typesetted _ on _ an _ old _ typewriter . it's _ on _ word . bloggers _ exposed _ this , or _ they _ worked _ hard _ to _ expose _ this . you _ know , blogs _ are _ scary . this _ is _ what _ you _ see . i _ see _ this , and _ i'm _ sure _ scared _ and _ i _ swear _ on _ stage _ shitless _ about _ blogs , because _ this _ is _ not _ something _ that's _ friendly . but _ there _ are _ blogs _ that _ are _ changing _ the _ way _ we _ read _ news _ and _ consume _ media , and , you _ know , these _ are _ great _ examples . these _ people _ are _ reaching _ thousands , if _ not _ millions , of _ readers , and _ that's _ incredibly _ important . during _ the _ hurricane , you _ had _ m _ s _ n.b _ c _ posting _ about _ the _ hurricane _ on _ their _ blog , updating _ it _ frequently . this _ was _ possible _ because _ of _ the _ easy _ nature _ of _ blogging _ tools . you _ have _ my _ friend , who _ has _ a _ blog _ on _ digital _ on _ p _ d _ r _ s , personal _ recorders . he _ makes _ enough _ money , just _ by _ running _ ads , to _ support _ his _ family _ up _ in _ oregon . that's _ all _ he _ does _ now , and _ this _ is _ something _ that _ blogs _ have _ made _ possible . and _ then _ you _ have _ something _ like _ this , which _ is _ interplast . it's _ a _ wonderful _ organization _ of _ people _ and _ doctors _ who _ go _ to _ developing _ nations _ to _ offer _ plastic _ surgery _ to _ those _ who _ need _ it . children _ with _ cleft _ palates _ will _ get _ it , and _ they _ document _ their _ story . this _ is _ wonderful . i _ am _ not _ that _ caring . i _ talk _ about _ myself . that's _ what _ i _ am . i'm _ a _ blogger . i _ have _ always _ decided _ that _ i _ was _ going _ to _ be _ an _ expert _ on _ one _ thing , and _ i _ am _ an _ expert _ on _ this _ person , and _ so _ i _ write _ about _ it . and _ the _ short _ story _ about _ my _ blog . it _ started _ in _ two _ thousand _ and _ one . i _ was _ twenty _ three . i _ wasn't _ happy _ with _ my _ job , because _ i _ was _ a _ designer , but _ i _ wasn't _ being _ really _ stimulated . i _ was _ an _ english _ major _ in _ college . i _ didn't _ have _ any _ use _ for _ it , but _ i _ missed _ writing . so , i _ started _ to _ write _ a _ blog _ and _ i _ started _ to _ create _ things _ like _ these _ little _ stories . this _ was _ an _ illustration _ about _ my _ camp _ experience _ when _ i _ was _ eleven _ years _ old , and _ how _ i _ went _ to _ a _ y _ m _ c.a _ camp _ christian _ camp _ and _ basically _ by _ the _ end , i _ had _ made _ my _ friends _ hate _ me _ so _ much _ that _ i _ hid _ in _ a _ bunk . they _ couldn't _ find _ me . they _ sent _ a _ search _ party , and _ i _ overheard _ people _ saying _ they _ wish _ i _ had _ killed _ myself , jumped _ off _ bible _ peak . you _ can _ laugh , this _ is _ ok . this _ is _ me . this _ is _ what _ happened _ to _ me . and _ when _ i _ started _ my _ blog _ it _ was _ really _ this _ one _ goal _ i _ said , i _ am _ not _ going _ to _ be _ famous _ to _ the _ world , but _ i _ could _ be _ famous _ to _ people _ on _ the _ internet . and _ i _ set _ a _ goal . i _ said , i'm _ going _ to _ win _ an _ award , because _ i _ had _ never _ won _ an _ award _ in _ my _ entire _ life . and _ i _ said , i'm _ going _ to _ win _ this _ award _ the _ south _ by _ southwest _ weblog _ award . and _ i _ won _ it . i _ reached _ all _ of _ these _ people , and _ i _ had _ tens _ of _ thousands _ of _ people _ reading _ about _ my _ life _ everyday . and _ then _ i _ wrote _ a _ post _ about _ a _ banjo . i _ wrote _ a _ post _ about _ wanting _ to _ buy _ a _ banjo _ a _ three _ hundred _ dollars _ banjo , which _ is _ a _ lot _ of _ money , and _ i _ don't _ play _ instruments . i _ don't _ know _ anything _ about _ music . i _ like _ music , and _ i _ like _ banjos , and _ i _ think _ i _ probably _ heard _ steve _ martin _ playing , and _ i _ said , i _ could _ do _ that . and _ i _ said _ to _ my _ husband , i _ said , ben , can _ i _ buy _ a _ banjo ? and _ he's _ like , no . and _ my _ husband _ this _ is _ my _ husband , who _ is _ very _ hot _ he _ won _ an _ award _ for _ being _ hot _ he _ told _ me , you _ cannot _ buy _ a _ banjo . you're _ just _ like _ your _ dad , who _ collects _ instruments . and _ i _ wrote _ a _ post _ about _ how _ i _ was _ so _ mad _ at _ him . he _ was _ such _ a _ tyrant _ because _ he _ would _ not _ let _ me _ buy _ this _ banjo . and _ those _ people _ who _ know _ me _ understood _ my _ joke . this _ is _ mena , this _ is _ how _ i _ make _ a _ joke _ at _ people . because _ the _ joke _ in _ this _ is _ that _ this _ person _ is _ not _ a _ tyrant . this _ person _ is _ so _ loving _ and _ so _ sweet _ that _ he _ lets _ me _ dress _ him _ up _ and _ post _ pictures _ of _ him _ to _ my _ blog . and _ if _ he _ knew _ i _ was _ showing _ this _ right _ now _ i _ put _ this _ in _ today _ he _ would _ kill _ me . but _ the _ thing _ was , i _ wrote _ this , and _ my _ friends _ read _ it , and _ they're _ like , oh , that _ mena , she _ wrote _ a _ post _ about , you _ know , wanting _ a _ stupid _ thing _ and _ being _ stupid . but _ i _ got _ emails _ from _ people _ that _ said , oh _ my _ god , your _ husband _ is _ such _ an _ asshole . how _ much _ money _ does _ he _ spend _ on _ beer _ in _ a _ year ? you _ could _ take _ that _ money _ and _ buy _ your _ banjo . why _ don't _ you _ open _ a _ separate _ account ? i've _ been _ with _ him _ since _ i _ was _ seventeen _ years _ old . we've _ never _ had _ a _ separate _ bank _ account . they _ said , separate _ your _ bank _ account _ spend _ your _ money . spend _ his _ money . that's _ it . and _ then _ i _ got _ people _ saying , leave _ him . and _ i _ was _ like , ok , what , who _ are _ these _ people ? and _ why _ are _ they _ reading _ this ? and _ i _ realized . i _ don't _ want _ to _ reach _ these _ people . i _ don't _ want _ to _ write _ for _ this _ public _ audience . and _ i _ started _ to _ kill _ my _ blog _ slowly . i'm _ like , i _ don't _ want _ to _ write _ this _ anymore , and _ i _ slowly _ and _ slowly _ and _ i _ did _ tell _ personal _ stories _ from _ time _ to _ then . i _ wrote _ this _ one , and _ i _ put _ this _ up _ because _ of _ einstein _ today . and _ i'm _ going _ to _ get _ choked _ up , because _ this _ is _ my _ first _ pet , and _ she _ passed _ away _ two _ years _ ago . and _ i _ decided _ to _ break _ from , i _ don't _ really _ write _ about _ my _ public _ life , because _ i _ wanted _ to _ give _ her _ a _ little _ memorial . but _ anyways . it's _ these _ sort _ of _ personal _ stories . you _ know , you _ read _ the _ blogs _ about _ politics , or _ about _ media , and _ gossip _ and _ all _ these _ things . these _ are _ out _ there , but _ it's _ more _ of _ the _ personal _ that _ interests _ me , and _ this _ is _ this _ is _ who _ i _ am . you _ see _ norman _ rockwell . and _ you _ have _ art _ critics _ say , norman _ rockwell _ is _ not _ art . norman _ rockwell _ hangs _ in _ living _ rooms _ and _ bathrooms , and _ this _ is _ not _ something _ to _ be _ considered _ high _ art . and _ i _ think _ this _ is _ one _ of _ the _ most _ important _ things _ to _ us _ as _ humans . these _ things _ resonate _ with _ us , and , if _ you _ think _ about _ blogs , you _ think _ of _ high _ art _ blogs , the _ history _ paintings _ about , you _ know , all _ biblical _ stories , and _ then _ you _ have _ this . these _ are _ the _ blogs _ that _ interest _ me . the _ people _ who _ just _ tell _ stories . one _ story _ is _ about _ this _ baby , and _ his _ name _ is _ odin . his _ father _ was _ a _ blogger . and _ he _ was _ writing _ his _ blog _ one _ day , and _ his _ wife _ gave _ birth _ to _ her _ baby _ at _ twenty _ five _ weeks . and _ he _ never _ expected _ this . one _ day _ it _ was _ normal . the _ next _ day _ it _ was _ hell . and _ this _ is _ a _ one _ pound _ baby . so _ odin _ was _ documented _ every _ single _ day . pictures _ were _ taken _ every _ day . day _ one , day _ two _ you _ have _ day _ nine _ they're _ talking _ about _ his _ apnea . day _ thirty _ nine _ he _ gets _ pneumonia . his _ baby _ is _ so _ small , and _ i've _ never _ encountered _ such _ a _ just _ a _ disturbing _ image , but _ just _ just _ so _ heartfelt . you're _ reading _ this _ as _ this _ happens , so _ on _ day _ fifty _ five , everybody _ reads _ that _ he's _ having _ failures . breathing _ failures _ and _ heart _ failures , and _ it's _ slowing _ down , and _ you _ don't _ know _ what _ to _ expect . but _ then _ it _ gets _ better . day _ ninety _ six _ he _ goes _ home . and _ you _ see _ this _ post . that's _ not _ something _ that _ you're _ going _ to _ see _ in _ a _ paper _ or _ a _ magazine _ but _ this _ is _ something _ that _ this _ person _ feels , and _ people _ are _ excited _ about _ it . twenty _ eight _ comments . that's _ not _ a _ huge _ amount _ of _ people _ reading , but _ twenty _ eight _ people _ matter . and _ today _ he _ is _ a _ healthy _ baby , who , if _ you _ read _ his _ blog _ it's _ snowdeal _ org , his _ father's _ blog _ he _ is _ taking _ pictures _ of _ him _ still , because _ he _ is _ still _ his _ son _ and _ he _ is , i _ think , at _ his _ age _ level _ right _ now _ because _ he _ had _ received _ such _ great _ treatment _ from _ the _ hospital . so , blogs . so _ what ? you've _ probably _ heard _ these _ things _ before . we _ talked _ about _ the _ w _ e _ l.l , and _ we _ talked _ about _ all _ these _ sort _ of _ things _ throughout _ our _ online _ history . but _ i _ think _ blogs _ are _ basically _ just _ an _ evolution , and _ that's _ where _ we _ are _ today . it's _ this _ record _ of _ who _ you _ are , your _ persona . you _ have _ your _ google _ search _ where _ you _ say , hey , what _ is _ mena _ trott ? and _ then _ you _ find _ these _ things _ and _ you're _ happy _ or _ unhappy . but _ then _ you _ also _ find _ people's _ blogs , and _ those _ are _ the _ records _ of _ people _ who _ are _ writing _ daily _ not _ necessarily _ about _ the _ same _ topic , but _ things _ that _ interest _ them . and _ we _ talk _ about _ the _ world _ flattens _ as _ being _ this _ panel , and _ i _ am _ very _ optimistic . whenever _ i _ think _ about _ blogs _ i'm _ like , oh , we've _ got _ to _ reach _ all _ these _ people . millions _ and _ hundreds _ of _ millions _ and _ billions _ of _ people . you _ know , we're _ getting _ into _ china , we _ want _ to _ be _ there , but _ you _ know , there _ are _ so _ many _ people _ who _ won't _ have _ the _ access _ to _ write _ a _ blog . but _ to _ see _ something _ like _ the _ one _ hundred _ dollars _ computer _ is _ amazing , because _ it's _ a _ blogging _ software _ is _ simple . we _ have _ a _ successful _ company _ because _ of _ timing , and _ because _ of _ perseverance , but _ it's _ simple _ stuff _ it's _ not _ rocket _ science . and _ so , that's _ an _ amazing _ thing _ to _ consider . so , the _ life _ record _ of _ a _ blog _ is _ something _ that _ i _ find _ incredibly _ important . we _ started _ with _ a _ slide _ of _ my _ teds , and _ i _ had _ to _ add _ this _ slide , because _ i _ knew _ that _ the _ minute _ i _ showed _ this , my _ mom _ my _ mom _ will _ see _ this _ deck _ somehow , because _ she _ does _ read _ my _ blog _ and _ she'll _ say , why _ wasn't _ there _ a _ picture _ of _ me ? this _ is _ my _ mom . so , i _ have _ all _ of _ the _ people _ that _ i _ know _ of . but _ this _ is _ basically _ the _ extent _ of _ the _ family _ that _ i _ know _ in _ terms _ of _ my _ direct _ line . i _ showed _ a _ norman _ rockwell _ painting _ before , and _ this _ one _ i _ grew _ up _ with , looking _ at _ constantly . i _ would _ spend _ hours _ looking _ at _ just _ the _ connections , saying , oh , the _ little _ kid _ up _ at _ the _ top _ has _ red _ hair . so _ does _ that _ first _ generation _ up _ there . and _ just _ these _ little _ things . this _ is _ not _ science , but _ this _ was _ enough _ for _ me _ to _ be _ really _ so _ interested _ in _ how _ we _ have _ evolved _ and _ how _ we _ can _ trace _ our _ line . so , that _ has _ always _ influenced _ me . i _ have _ this _ record , this _ nineteen _ ten _ census _ of _ another _ grabowski _ that's _ my _ maiden _ name _ and _ there's _ a _ theodore , because _ there's _ always _ a _ theodore . this _ is _ all _ i _ have . i _ have _ a _ couple _ of _ facts _ about _ somebody . i _ have _ their _ date _ of _ birth , and _ their _ age , and _ what _ they _ did _ in _ their _ household , if _ they _ spoke _ english , and _ that's _ it . that's _ all _ i _ know _ of _ these _ people . and _ it's _ pretty _ sad , because _ i _ only _ go _ back _ five _ generations , and _ then _ it's _ it . i _ don't _ even _ know _ what _ happens _ on _ my _ mom's _ side , because _ she's _ from _ cuba _ and _ i _ don't _ have _ that _ many _ things . and _ just _ doing _ this _ i _ spent _ time _ in _ the _ archives _ that's _ another _ thing _ why _ my _ husband's _ a _ saint _ i _ spent _ time _ in _ the _ washington _ archives , just _ sitting _ there , looking _ for _ these _ things . now _ it's _ online , but _ he _ sat _ through _ that . and _ so _ you _ have _ this _ record _ and , you _ know , this _ is _ my _ great _ great _ grandmother . this _ is _ the _ only _ picture _ i _ have . and _ to _ think _ of _ what _ we _ have _ the _ ability _ to _ do _ with _ our _ blogs . to _ think _ about _ the _ people _ who _ are _ on _ those _ one _ hundred _ dollars _ computers _ talking _ about _ who _ they _ are , sharing _ these _ personal _ stories _ this _ is _ an _ amazing _ thing . another _ photo _ that _ has _ greatly _ influenced _ me , or _ a _ series _ of _ photos , is _ this _ project _ that's _ done _ by _ an _ argentinean _ man _ and _ his _ wife . and _ he's _ basically _ taking _ a _ picture _ of _ his _ family _ everyday _ for _ the _ past , what _ is _ sevensix _ twenty , oh _ my _ god , i'm _ sevenseven _ twenty _ nine _ years ? twenty _ nine _ years . there _ was _ a _ joke , originally , about _ my _ graph _ that _ i _ left _ out , which _ is . you _ see _ all _ this _ math ? i'm _ just _ happy _ i _ was _ able _ to _ add _ it _ up _ to _ one _ hundred , because _ that's _ my _ skill _ set . so _ you _ have _ these _ people _ aging , and _ now _ this _ is _ them _ today , or _ last _ year , and _ that's _ a _ powerful _ thing _ to _ have , to _ be _ able _ to _ track _ this . i _ wish _ that _ i _ would _ have _ this _ of _ my _ family . i _ know _ that _ one _ day _ my _ children _ will _ be _ wondering _ or _ my _ grandchildren , or _ my _ great _ grandchildren , if _ i _ ever _ have _ children _ what _ i _ am _ going _ to _ who _ i _ was , so _ i _ do _ something _ that's _ very _ narcissistic . i _ am _ a _ blogger _ that _ is _ an _ amazing _ thing _ for _ me , because _ it _ captures _ a _ moment _ in _ time _ everyday . i _ take _ a _ picture _ of _ myself _ i've _ been _ doing _ this _ since _ last _ year _ every _ single _ day . and , you _ know , it's _ the _ same _ picture . it's _ basically _ the _ same _ person . only _ a _ couple _ of _ people _ read _ it . i _ don't _ write _ this _ for _ this _ audience . i'm _ showing _ it _ now , but _ i _ would _ go _ insane _ if _ this _ was _ really _ public . about _ four _ people _ probably _ read _ it , and _ they _ tell _ me , you _ know , you _ haven't _ updated _ i'm _ probably _ going _ to _ get _ people _ telling _ me _ i _ haven't _ updated _ but _ this _ is _ something _ that's _ amazing , because _ i _ can _ go _ back _ to _ a _ day _ i _ can _ go _ back _ to _ april _ two _ thousand _ and _ five , and _ say , what _ was _ i _ doing _ this _ day ? i _ look _ at _ it , i _ know _ exactly . it's _ this _ visual _ cue _ that _ is _ so _ important _ to _ what _ we _ do . i _ put _ the _ bad _ pictures _ up _ too , because _ there _ are _ bad _ pictures . and _ i _ remember _ instantly . i _ am _ in _ germany _ in _ this _ i _ had _ to _ go _ for _ a _ one _ day _ trip . i _ was _ sick , and _ i _ was _ in _ a _ hotel _ room , and _ i _ wanted _ not _ to _ be _ there . and _ so _ you _ see _ these _ things . it's _ not _ just _ always _ smiling . now _ i've _ kind _ of _ evolved _ it , so _ i _ have _ this _ look . if _ you _ look _ at _ my _ driver's _ license _ i _ have _ the _ same _ look , and _ it's _ it's _ a _ pretty _ disturbing _ thing _ but _ it's _ something _ that _ is _ really _ important . and _ the _ last _ story _ i _ really _ want _ to _ tell _ is _ this _ story , because _ this _ is _ probably _ the _ one _ that _ means _ the _ most _ to _ me _ in _ all _ of _ what _ i'm _ doing . and _ i'll _ probably _ get _ choked _ up , because _ i _ tend _ to _ when _ i _ talk _ about _ this . so , this _ woman , her _ name _ was _ emma , and _ she _ was _ a _ blogger _ on _ our _ service , typepad . and _ she _ was _ a _ beta _ tester , so _ she _ was _ there _ right _ when _ we _ opened _ you _ know , there _ were _ one _ hundred _ people _ and _ she _ wrote _ about _ her _ life _ dealing _ with _ cancer . she _ was _ writing _ and _ writing _ and _ writing , and _ we _ all _ started _ reading _ it , because _ we _ had _ so _ few _ blogs _ on _ the _ service , we _ could _ keep _ track _ of _ everyone . and _ she _ was _ writing _ one _ day , and , you _ know , then _ she _ disappeared _ for _ a _ little _ bit . and _ her _ sister _ came _ on , and _ she _ said _ that _ emma _ had _ passed _ away . and _ all _ of _ our _ support _ staff _ who _ had _ talked _ to _ her _ were _ really _ emotional , and _ it _ was _ a _ very _ hard _ day _ at _ the _ company . and _ this _ was _ one _ of _ those _ instances _ where _ i _ realized _ how _ much _ blogging _ affects _ our _ relationship , and _ flattening _ this _ sort _ of _ world . that _ this _ woman _ is _ in _ england , and _ she _ lives _ she _ lived _ a _ life _ where _ she _ was _ talking _ about _ what _ she _ was _ doing . but _ the _ big _ thing _ that _ really _ influenced _ us _ was , her _ sister _ wrote _ to _ me , and _ she _ said , you _ know , and _ she _ wrote _ on _ this _ blog , that _ writing _ her _ blog _ during _ the _ last _ couple _ of _ months _ of _ her _ life _ was _ probably _ the _ best _ thing _ that _ had _ happened _ to _ her , and _ being _ able _ to _ talk _ to _ people , being _ able _ to _ share _ what _ was _ going _ on , and _ being _ able _ to _ write _ and _ receive _ comments . and _ that _ was _ amazing _ to _ be _ able _ to _ know _ that _ we _ had _ empowered _ that , and _ that _ blogging _ was _ something _ that _ she _ felt _ comfortable _ doing , and _ that _ the _ idea _ that _ blogging _ doesn't _ have _ to _ be _ scary , that _ we _ don't _ always _ have _ to _ be _ attack _ of _ the _ blogs , that _ we _ can _ be _ people _ who _ are _ open , and _ wanting _ to _ help _ and _ talk _ to _ people . that _ was _ an _ amazing _ thing . and _ and _ so _ i _ printed _ out _ her _ or _ i _ sent _ a _ p _ d _ f _ of _ her _ blog _ to _ her _ family , and _ they _ passed _ it _ out _ at _ her _ memorial _ service , and _ even _ in _ her _ obituary , they _ mentioned _ her _ blog _ because _ it _ was _ such _ a _ big _ part _ of _ her _ life . and _ that's _ a _ huge _ thing . so , this _ is _ her _ legacy , and _ i _ think _ that _ my _ call _ to _ action _ to _ all _ of _ you _ is . you _ know , think _ about _ blogs , think _ about _ what _ they _ are , think _ about _ what _ you've _ thought _ of _ them , and _ then _ actually _ do _ it , because _ it's _ something _ that _ is _ really _ going _ to _ change _ our _ lives . so , thank _ you _ i'm _ michael _ shermer , director _ of _ the _ skeptics _ society , publisher _ of _ skeptic _ magazine . we _ investigate _ claims _ of _ the _ paranormal , pseudo _ science , fringe _ groups _ and _ cults , and _ claims _ of _ all _ kinds _ between , science _ and _ pseudo _ science _ and _ non _ science _ and _ junk _ science , voodoo _ science , pathological _ science , bad _ science , non _ science , and _ plain _ old _ non _ sense . and _ unless _ you've _ been _ on _ mars _ recently , you _ know _ there's _ a _ lot _ of _ that _ out _ there . some _ people _ call _ us _ debunkers , which _ is _ kind _ of _ a _ negative _ term . but _ let's _ face _ it , there's _ a _ lot _ of _ bunk . we _ are _ like _ the _ bunko _ squads _ of _ the _ police _ departments _ out _ there _ well , we're _ sort _ of _ like _ the _ ralph _ naders _ of _ bad _ ideas , trying _ to _ replace _ bad _ ideas _ with _ good _ ideas . i'll _ show _ you _ an _ example _ of _ a _ bad _ idea . i _ brought _ this _ with _ me , this _ was _ given _ to _ us _ by _ n _ b _ c _ dateline _ to _ test . it's _ produced _ by _ the _ quadro _ corporation _ of _ west _ virginia . it's _ called _ the _ quadro _ two _ thousand _ dowser _ rod . this _ was _ being _ sold _ to _ high _ school _ administrators _ for _ nine _ hundred _ dollars _ apiece . it's _ a _ piece _ of _ plastic _ with _ a _ radio _ shack _ antenna _ attached _ to _ it . you _ could _ dowse _ for _ all _ sorts _ of _ things , but _ this _ particular _ one _ was _ built _ to _ dowse _ for _ marijuana _ in _ students _ lockers . so _ the _ way _ it _ works _ is _ you _ go _ down _ the _ hallway , and _ you _ see _ if _ it _ tilts _ toward _ a _ particular _ locker , and _ then _ you _ open _ the _ locker . so _ it _ looks _ something _ like _ this . i'll _ show _ you . well , it _ has _ kind _ of _ a _ right _ leaning _ bias . well , this _ is _ science , so _ we'll _ do _ a _ controlled _ experiment . it'll _ go _ this _ way _ for _ sure . sir , do _ you _ want _ to _ empty _ your _ pockets , please , sir ? so _ the _ question _ was , can _ it _ actually _ find _ marijuana _ in _ students _ lockers ? and _ the _ answer _ is , if _ you _ open _ enough _ of _ them , yes . but _ in _ science , we _ have _ to _ keep _ track _ of _ the _ misses , not _ just _ the _ hits . and _ that's _ probably _ the _ key _ lesson _ to _ my _ short _ talk _ here . this _ is _ how _ psychics _ work , astrologers , tarot _ card _ readers _ and _ so _ on . people _ remember _ the _ hits _ and _ forget _ the _ misses . in _ science , we _ keep _ the _ whole _ database , and _ look _ to _ see _ if _ the _ number _ of _ hits _ somehow _ stands _ out _ from _ the _ total _ number _ you'd _ expect _ by _ chance . in _ this _ case , we _ tested _ it . we _ had _ two _ opaque _ boxes . one _ with _ government _ approved _ t _ h _ c _ marijuana , and _ one _ with _ nothing . and _ it _ got _ it _ fifty _ percent _ of _ the _ time _ which _ is _ exactly _ what _ you'd _ expect _ with _ a _ coin _ flip _ model . so _ that's _ just _ a _ fun _ little _ example _ here _ of _ the _ sorts _ of _ things _ we _ do . skeptic _ is _ the _ quarterly _ publication . each _ one _ has _ a _ particular _ theme . this _ one _ is _ on _ the _ future _ of _ intelligence . are _ people _ getting _ smarter _ or _ dumber ? i _ have _ an _ opinion _ of _ this _ myself _ because _ of _ the _ business _ i'm _ in , but _ in _ fact , people , it _ turns _ out , are _ getting _ smarter . three _ i _ q _ points _ per _ ten _ years , going _ up . sort _ of _ an _ interesting _ thing . with _ science , don't _ think _ of _ skepticism _ as _ a _ thing , or _ science _ as _ a _ thing . are _ science _ and _ religion _ compatible ? it's _ like , are _ science _ and _ plumbing _ compatible ? they're _ just _ two _ different _ things . science _ is _ not _ a _ thing . it's _ a _ verb . it's _ a _ way _ of _ thinking _ about _ things . it's _ a _ way _ of _ looking _ for _ natural _ explanations _ for _ all _ phenomena . i _ mean , what's _ more _ likely . that _ extraterrestrial _ intelligences _ or _ multi _ dimensional _ beings _ travel _ across _ vast _ distances _ of _ interstellar _ space _ to _ leave _ a _ crop _ circle _ in _ farmer _ bob's _ field _ in _ puckerbrush , kansas _ to _ promote _ skeptic _ com , our _ web _ page ? or _ is _ it _ more _ likely _ that _ a _ reader _ of _ skeptic _ did _ this _ with _ photoshop ? and _ in _ all _ cases _ we _ have _ to _ ask _ what's _ the _ more _ likely _ explanation ? before _ we _ say _ something _ is _ out _ of _ this _ world , we _ should _ first _ make _ sure _ that _ it's _ not _ in _ this _ world . what's _ more _ likely . that _ arnold _ had _ extraterrestrial _ help _ in _ his _ run _ for _ the _ governorship , or _ that _ the _ world _ weekly _ news _ makes _ stuff _ up ? the _ same _ theme _ is _ expressed _ nicely _ here _ in _ this _ sidney _ harris _ cartoon . for _ those _ of _ you _ in _ the _ back , it _ says _ here . then _ a _ miracle _ occurs . i _ think _ you _ need _ to _ be _ more _ explicit _ here _ in _ step _ two . this _ single _ slide _ completely _ dismantles _ the _ intelligent _ design _ arguments . there's _ nothing _ more _ to _ it _ than _ that . you _ can _ say _ a _ miracle _ occurs , it's _ just _ that _ it _ doesn't _ explain _ anything _ or _ offer _ anything . there's _ nothing _ to _ test . it's _ the _ end _ of _ the _ conversation _ for _ intelligent _ design _ creationists . and _ it's _ true , scientists _ sometimes _ throw _ terms _ out _ as _ linguistic _ place _ fillers _ dark _ energy _ or _ dark _ matter , something _ like _ that _ until _ we _ figure _ out _ what _ it _ is , we'll _ call _ it _ this . it's _ the _ beginning _ of _ the _ causal _ chain _ for _ science . for _ intelligent _ design _ creationists , it's _ the _ end _ of _ the _ chain . so _ again , we _ can _ ask _ this . what's _ more _ likely ? are _ u _ f _ o _ s _ alien _ spaceships , or _ perceptual _ cognitive _ mistakes , or _ even _ fakes ? this _ is _ a _ u _ f _ o _ shot _ from _ my _ house _ in _ altadena , california , looking _ down _ over _ pasadena . and _ if _ it _ looks _ a _ lot _ like _ a _ buick _ hubcap , it's _ because _ it _ is . you _ don't _ even _ need _ photoshop _ or _ high _ tech _ equipment , you _ don't _ need _ computers . this _ was _ shot _ with _ a _ throwaway _ kodak _ instamatic _ camera . you _ just _ have _ somebody _ off _ on _ the _ side _ with _ a _ hubcap _ ready _ to _ go . camera's _ ready _ that's _ it . so , although _ it's _ possible _ that _ most _ of _ these _ things _ are _ fake _ or _ illusions _ or _ so _ on , and _ that _ some _ of _ them _ are _ real , it's _ more _ likely _ that _ all _ of _ them _ are _ fake , like _ the _ crop _ circles . on _ a _ more _ serious _ note , in _ all _ of _ science _ we're _ looking _ for _ a _ balance _ between _ data _ and _ theory . in _ the _ case _ of _ galileo , he _ had _ two _ problems _ when _ he _ turned _ his _ telescope _ to _ saturn . first _ of _ all , there _ was _ no _ theory _ of _ planetary _ rings . second _ of _ all , his _ data _ was _ grainy _ and _ fuzzy , and _ he _ couldn't _ quite _ make _ out _ what _ he _ was _ looking _ at . so _ he _ wrote _ that _ he _ had _ seen _ i _ have _ observed _ that _ the _ furthest _ planet _ has _ three _ bodies . and _ this _ is _ what _ he _ ended _ up _ concluding _ that _ he _ saw . so _ without _ a _ theory _ of _ planetary _ rings _ and _ with _ only _ grainy _ data , you _ can't _ have _ a _ good _ theory . it _ wasn't _ solved _ until _ sixteen _ fifty _ five . this _ is _ christiaan _ huygens's _ book _ that _ catalogs _ all _ the _ mistakes _ people _ made _ trying _ to _ figure _ out _ what _ was _ going _ on _ with _ saturn . it _ wasn't _ till _ huygens _ had _ two _ things . he _ had _ a _ good _ theory _ of _ planetary _ rings _ and _ how _ the _ solar _ system _ operated , and _ he _ had _ better _ telescopic , more _ fine _ grain _ data _ in _ which _ he _ could _ figure _ out _ that _ as _ the _ earth _ is _ going _ around _ faster _ according _ to _ kepler's _ laws _ than _ saturn , then _ we _ catch _ up _ with _ it . and _ we _ see _ the _ angles _ of _ the _ rings _ at _ different _ angles , there . and _ that , in _ fact , turns _ out _ to _ be _ true . the _ problem _ with _ having _ a _ theory _ is _ that _ it _ may _ be _ loaded _ with _ cognitive _ biases . so _ one _ of _ the _ problems _ of _ explaining _ why _ people _ believe _ weird _ things _ is _ that _ we _ have _ things , on _ a _ simple _ level , and _ then _ i'll _ go _ to _ more _ serious _ ones . like , we _ have _ a _ tendency _ to _ see _ faces . this _ is _ the _ face _ on _ mars . in _ nineteen _ seventy _ six , where _ there _ was _ a _ whole _ movement _ to _ get _ n _ a _ s.a _ to _ photograph _ that _ area _ because _ people _ thought _ this _ was _ monumental _ architecture _ made _ by _ martians . here's _ the _ close _ up _ of _ it _ from _ two _ thousand _ and _ one . if _ you _ squint , you _ can _ still _ see _ the _ face . and _ when _ you're _ squinting , you're _ turning _ that _ from _ fine _ grain _ to _ coarse _ grain , so _ you're _ reducing _ the _ quality _ of _ your _ data . and _ if _ i _ didn't _ tell _ you _ what _ to _ look _ for , you'd _ still _ see _ the _ face , because _ we're _ programmed _ by _ evolution _ to _ see _ faces . faces _ are _ important _ for _ us _ socially . and _ of _ course , happy _ faces , faces _ of _ all _ kinds _ are _ easy _ to _ see . you _ see _ the _ happy _ face _ on _ mars , there . if _ astronomers _ were _ frogs , perhaps _ they'd _ see _ kermit _ the _ frog . do _ you _ see _ him _ there ? little _ froggy _ legs . or _ if _ geologists _ were _ elephants ? religious _ iconography . discovered _ by _ a _ tennessee _ baker _ in _ nineteen _ ninety _ six . he _ charged _ five _ bucks _ a _ head _ to _ come _ see _ the _ nun _ bun _ till _ he _ got _ a _ cease _ and _ desist _ from _ mother _ teresa's _ lawyer . here's _ our _ lady _ of _ guadalupe _ and _ our _ lady _ of _ watsonville , just _ down _ the _ street , or _ is _ it _ up _ the _ street _ from _ here ? tree _ bark _ is _ particularly _ good _ because _ it's _ nice _ and _ grainy , branchy , black _ and _ white _ splotchy _ and _ you _ can _ get _ the _ pattern _ seeking _ humans _ are _ pattern _ seeking _ animals . here's _ the _ virgin _ mary _ on _ the _ side _ of _ a _ glass _ window _ in _ sao _ paulo . here's _ when _ the _ virgin _ mary _ made _ her _ appearance _ on _ a _ cheese _ sandwich _ which _ i _ got _ to _ actually _ hold _ in _ a _ las _ vegas _ casino _ of _ course , this _ being _ america . this _ casino _ paid _ twenty _ eight,fivezerozero _ dollars _ on _ ebay _ for _ the _ cheese _ sandwich . but _ who _ does _ it _ really _ look _ like ? the _ virgin _ mary ? it _ has _ that _ sort _ of _ puckered _ lips , nineteen _ forties _ era _ look . virgin _ mary _ in _ clearwater , florida . i _ actually _ went _ to _ see _ this _ one . there _ was _ a _ lot _ of _ people _ there . the _ faithful _ come _ in _ their _ wheelchairs _ and _ crutches , and _ so _ on . we _ went _ down _ and _ investigated . just _ to _ give _ you _ a _ size , that's _ dawkins , me _ and _ the _ amazing _ randi , next _ to _ this _ two , two _ and _ a _ half _ story _ sized _ image . all _ these _ candles , thousands _ of _ candles _ people _ had _ lit _ in _ tribute _ to _ this . so _ we _ walked _ around _ the _ backside , to _ see _ what _ was _ going _ on . it _ turns _ out _ wherever _ there's _ a _ sprinkler _ head _ and _ a _ palm _ tree , you _ get _ the _ effect . here's _ the _ virgin _ mary _ on _ the _ backside , which _ they _ started _ to _ wipe _ off . i _ guess _ you _ can _ only _ have _ one _ miracle _ per _ building . so _ is _ it _ really _ a _ miracle _ of _ mary , or _ is _ it _ a _ miracle _ of _ marge ? and _ now _ i'm _ going _ to _ finish _ up _ with _ another _ example _ of _ this , with _ auditory _ illusions . there's _ this _ film , white _ noise , with _ michael _ keaton , about _ the _ dead _ talking _ back _ to _ us . by _ the _ way , the _ whole _ business _ of _ talking _ to _ the _ dead _ is _ not _ that _ big _ a _ deal . anybody _ can _ do _ it , turns _ out . it's _ getting _ the _ dead _ to _ talk _ back _ that's _ the _ really _ hard _ part . in _ this _ case , supposedly , these _ messages _ are _ hidden _ in _ electronic _ phenomena . there's _ a _ reversespeech _ com _ web _ page _ where _ i _ downloaded _ this _ stuff . this _ is _ the _ most _ famous _ one _ of _ all _ of _ these . here's _ the _ forward _ version _ of _ the _ very _ famous _ song . if _ there's _ a _ bustle _ in _ your _ hedgerow _ don't _ be _ alarmed _ now . it's _ just _ a _ spring _ clean _ for _ the _ may _ queen . yes , there _ are _ two _ paths _ you _ can _ go _ by , but _ in _ the _ long _ run , there's _ still _ time _ to _ change _ the _ road _ you're _ on _ couldn't _ you _ just _ listen _ to _ that _ all _ day ? all _ right , here _ it _ is _ backwards , and _ see _ if _ you _ can _ hear _ the _ hidden _ messages _ that _ are _ supposedly _ in _ there . satan . what _ did _ you _ get ? satan . satan . ok , at _ least _ we _ got _ satan . now , i'll _ prime _ the _ auditory _ part _ of _ your _ brain _ to _ tell _ you _ what _ you're _ supposed _ to _ hear , and _ then _ hear _ it _ again . you _ can't _ miss _ it _ when _ i _ tell _ you _ what's _ there . i'm _ going _ to _ just _ end _ with _ a _ positive , nice _ little _ story . the _ skeptics _ is _ a _ nonprofit _ educational _ organization . we're _ always _ looking _ for _ little _ good _ things _ that _ people _ do . and _ in _ england , there's _ a _ pop _ singer . one _ of _ the _ top _ popular _ singers _ in _ england _ today , katie _ melua . and _ she _ wrote _ a _ beautiful _ song . it _ was _ in _ the _ top _ five _ in _ two _ thousand _ and _ five , called , nine _ million _ bicycles _ in _ beijing . it's _ a _ love _ story _ she's _ sort _ of _ the _ norah _ jones _ of _ the _ u _ k _ about _ how _ she _ much _ loves _ her _ guy , and _ compared _ to _ nine _ million _ bicycles , and _ so _ forth . and _ she _ has _ this _ one _ passage _ here . we _ are _ twelve _ billion _ light _ years _ from _ the _ edge _ that's _ a _ guess , no _ one _ can _ ever _ say _ it's _ true , but _ i _ know _ that _ i _ will _ always _ be _ with _ you . well , that's _ nice . at _ least _ she _ got _ it _ close . in _ america _ it'd _ be , we're _ six _ thousand _ light _ years _ from _ the _ edge . but _ my _ friend , simon _ singh , the _ particle _ physicist _ now _ turned _ science _ educator , who _ wrote _ the _ book _ the _ big _ bang , and _ so _ on , uses _ every _ chance _ he _ gets _ to _ promote _ good _ science . and _ so _ he _ wrote _ an _ op _ ed _ piece _ in _ the _ guardian _ about _ katie's _ song , in _ which _ he _ said , well , we _ know _ exactly _ how _ far _ from _ the _ edge . you _ know , it's _ thirteen _ point _ seven _ billion _ light _ years , and _ it's _ not _ a _ guess . we _ know _ within _ precise _ error _ bars _ how _ close _ it _ is . so _ we _ can _ say , although _ not _ absolutely _ true , it's _ pretty _ close _ to _ being _ true . and , to _ his _ credit , katie _ called _ him _ up _ after _ this _ op _ ed _ piece _ came _ out , and _ said , i'm _ so _ embarrassed . i _ was _ in _ the _ astronomy _ club . i _ should've _ known _ better . and _ she _ re _ cut _ the _ song . so _ i _ will _ end _ with _ the _ new _ version . we _ are _ thirteen _ point _ seven _ billion _ light _ years _ from _ the _ edge _ of _ the _ observable _ universe . that's _ a _ good _ estimate _ with _ well _ defined _ error _ bars . and _ with _ the _ available _ information , i _ predict _ that _ i _ will _ always _ be _ with _ you . how _ cool _ is _ that
